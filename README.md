# knight_tour_SAT

This repository hosts the project for the course "Logic for Computer Science" (Autumn 2025, Uliège, Pascal Fontaine & Tom Clara).

It consists in solving the Knight's Tour problem on chessboards of any size, encoded to SAT and solved with python-sat. The project explores some variations of the problem. It might evolve in the future if I come back to it to implement e.g. more efficient encodings.
